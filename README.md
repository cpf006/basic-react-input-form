# Description

A user-friendly form designed to capture statistical data related to a sample set. It provides fields for users to input key statistical measures. The form provides real-time validation feedback to ensure that users input valid data.

## Validations

- Sample Size: The number of observations in the sample. It must be a whole number &gt;= 2

- Sample Mean: The average value of the observations in the sample. It accepts any numeric value.

- Standard Deviation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the set of values. It accepts any numeric value &gt; 0

- Hypothesized Mean: The proposed average value against which the sample mean can be tested. This field becomes active only when the "Perform Hypothesis Test" checkbox is checked. It accepts any numeric value.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
